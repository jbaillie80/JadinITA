#1) Make two string variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

x="jinx"
y="jinx"
z=x==y
print(z)

#2) Make two int variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

x=4
y=3
z=x==4
print(z)

#3) Make two int variables. Compare them using the > operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

x=4
y=3
z=x>4
print(z)

#4) Make two int variables. Compare them using the < operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

x=4
y=3
z=x<4
print(z)

#5) Make two int variables. Compare them using the >= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

x=4
y=3
z=x>=4
print(z)

#6) Make two int variables. Compare them using the <= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

x=4
y=3
z=x<=4
print(z)

#7) Make a comparison with any operator, with one of the common SYNTAX errors.

x=4
y=3
z=x=4
print(z)
