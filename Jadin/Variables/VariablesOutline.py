c="Words"
d=True
e=["Risk", "of", "Rain"]


#2)
#Make two variables one named 'a' and one named 'A' both set to  different data:
#(Remember that capitalization matters, so these can be two different variables)

a=22
A=33

#3)
#Make a variable, and then go down a couple lines and change the data in that
#same variable:

f=99
f=100

#4)
#Make a variable and set it to a variable you have already created:

d=False

#5)
#Make a list with three items. Make a variable that is set to the second
#item in that list:

e=["Risk ", "of ", "Rain"]
g=e[1]

#6)
#Make a String set to your name. Make a variable that is set to the first
#character in that string:
